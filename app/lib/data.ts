    about: [
        `Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into
        the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of
        building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a
        huge corporation, and a digital product studio.`,
        `My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces for our customers at
        Klaviyo. I most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and
        engineering meet — things that look good but are also built well under the hood. In my free time,
        I've also released an online video course that covers everything you need to know
        to build a web app with the Spotify API.`,
        `When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two
        cats, or running around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds.`,
